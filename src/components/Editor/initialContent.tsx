        Understanding Tailwind CSS
      </h2>
      <p>
        Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that
        provides a set of utility classes representing common CSS properties.
        Unlike traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, Tailwind
        CSS doesn't come with pre-designed components or layouts. Instead, it
        offers a vast array of utility classes that can be used to style HTML
        elements directly in the markup.

        Tailwind CSS accelerates the development process by eliminating the need
        to write custom CSS for every styling requirement. Developers can
        leverage utility classes directly within their HTML markup, reducing the
        time spent switching between HTML and CSS files. This approach fosters a
        more efficient workflow and allows for rapid prototyping and iteration.
